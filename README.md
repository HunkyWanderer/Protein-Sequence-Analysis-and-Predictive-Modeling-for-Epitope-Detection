# Protein-Sequence-Analysis-and-Predictive-Modeling-for-Epitope-Detection
Developed a predictive model to identify B-cell epitopes in protein sequences. Tasks included data cleaning, feature selection using Fisherâ€™s score, and data balancing with SMOTE. Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers were optimized through validation and parameter tuning, achieving an AUC score of 0.56 on new data.
